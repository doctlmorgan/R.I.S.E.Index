The **RISE Index** (Reflexive Inquiry for Systemic Equity) is a web-based leadership assessment designed to assess how equity principles manifest in professional practice, decision-making, and institutional dynamics.

Built around five dimensions — *Reality Reckoning, Indeterminate Becoming, Disruptive Engagement, Emancipatory Shift,* and *Radical Renewal* — this tool invites leaders to reflect on how power, identity, disruption, transformation, and relational renewal shape their impact.

The assessment is not about perfection, but about practice:
-  **100-point scoring** for each principle and facet (with reverse-coded items)
-  Interactive tiering output (**Engaging**, **Enacting**, **Empowering**)
-  Responsive, mobile-friendly design with **auto-advance** and **progress indicators**
-  Supports **result emailing** to `empowering.voices@outlook.com` with consent
-  Fully customizable for institutional branding and integration

Designed for change-makers in equity and leadership roles, the RISE Index supports critical awareness, alignment, and accountability. Let’s rise—together.
